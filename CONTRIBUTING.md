## 1. Code Formatting and Linting

- **Prettier**: Ensure that Prettier is installed and used for code formatting.
- **ESLint**: Configure ESLint for code linting. Prettier and ESLint must work together for consistent code style.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev prettier eslint
  ```
